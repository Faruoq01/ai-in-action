"###Input :8F, 78lbs, no medication. She was in the hospital for a long time but they discharged her. She is still in pain, please help. I attached the notes of her discharge.The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as within normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever. ###Output :Internal medicine doc here but in my differential is Adult Onset Stills Disease which can still present in children and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The salmon colored rash lasting a few minutes is textbook for Adult Onset Stills Disease.I'm assuming she had blood cultures done at one or multiple points during her admission. Did she have a procalcitonin tested? Did she receive any antibiotics? Any steroids like solumedrol, prednisone etc? Does she still have joint pain? Does this rash show up only during febrile episodes? Any auto immune conditions in the family like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, hashimotos?",ERROR,
"###Input :Age: 8Height/weight: Average, not sure exactly but last i was told, she's within normal rangeFemaleCaucasian/ HispanicNo previous medical history, no prior surgeriesnon-smoking householdWe all had covid in December 26th. It was rough but we all recovered. Me and my husband were vaccinated. My kids weren't because their clinic wasn't providing the vaccines yet.I'm going to try to be thorough as possible because it's just so much going on with her and i don't know where to start and her symptoms are all over the place... Last summer she was in someone's house that had a rabbit. The rabbit was filthy and it scratched the top part of her hand. Her hand began looking infected because even though i washed it and put neosporin on it, kids are kids and she couldn't keep it clean and soon it began looking red. She got a fever roughly around that time and was complaining of headaches and that her ""throat feels tight"". I took her to her clinic and they drew blood to test her for ""rabbit scratch fever"" It came back negative..They figured she just caught a virus and nothing became of it. The scratch eventually healed with an ointment they gave her. That same summer she..again...being a kid, didn't listen to me and was rolling in grass in her grandmother's yard which we have found ticks in. She ended up with a tick in her head which by the time we noticed it amongst her hair was engorged. I pried it off her. My daughter again, began complaining of headaches and her body hurting, ""tight"" throat. I took her to the ER and had her get tested for lyme disease it came back negative..It's now almost a year later and her headaches ""tight throat"" and body pain just come and go sporadically. I would chalk it up to growing pains which is what everyone was telling me. Her doctor never seems concerned...But sometimes the headaches are so intense she will cry and lay down and ask for a cold towel for her head...she's 8. And now on top of it all she's got new symptoms. She came to me about a week ago saying her butt felt weird like it had ""dots"". I tell her to show me and all over her butt and upper thigh area she is covered in what look to be pimples. Its so odd. My mind automatically went to ""bed bugs!"" So i checked the beds from top to bottom but found nothing. She still has trouble sleeping some nights and comes to sleep on our bed so if it was bed bugs why is she the only one with the dots? I'm checking her daily and it's as if she's got a new ""pimple"" everyday...again, she's 8...wth..Another new symptom she has is she's been getting heart palpitations. One minute she's playing on the floor or on the sofa, and the next she will come to me saying her heart is beating rapidly. I put my head on her heart and i feel her heart beating quickly. It scares her and i have to scoop her up and hold her for a while. She has also started hypervenilating when she's upset. Something she's NEVER done in her life. We aren't strict with her and she's a happy child, why would she start doing that? She says she can't help it.I took her to her doctor roughly two-three weeks ago because i had enough, i told her doctor everything from the summer to now. From the body pain to the heart pain and showed him her butt pimples and asked him to please help because we are at our wits end. He checked her out and said her heart sounds fine to him. He also was dismissive towards her skin problem. He did however notice the lymph nodes around her neck were really swollen. He ordered her to get blood work done and it came back last week. She has covid anti-bodies in her blood. She tested negative again for lyme (im guessing he just wanted to double check in case the other one was a false negative) and showed what he thinks might be her in ""Recovering"" state of cat scratch fever? ...ok? We have cats so i guess that's possible. He sounded so unsure with himself. Sighing a lot and kept going ""eh...i don't really know what to tell you..."" and stumped with her blood work. He sent her a prescription for Azithromycin just to be safe. She has to take this every day after dinner.Thing is, she's still complaining about her various symptoms. And it's been days since she got the medicine and now she's more frequently telling me her hearts beating quickly. So im afraid to continue giving her the medicine in case that's whats causing the palpitations. I have sent various messages to her doctor two days ago but he isn't calling me back. I'm tired of waiting for him and already went ahead and made her an appointment for both pediatric cardiology and dermatology. I also found a new pediatrician because i've had it with this guy. Both appointments are next week. But until then i'm just a bundle of nerves. I hate when she comes to me saying her heart hurts or her head hurts. Can anyone here please tell me whats wrong with my baby girl?Edit: were at the ER now. She started complaining of heart pain and palpitations and Im done waiting. Will update depending on what they say ###Output :Time for a new doctor. Its not typical for 8 year olds to get heart palpitations",ERROR,
"###Input :35F, 145lbs, 511 dont smoke, drink rarely. Generally consider myself healthy, however mid last year I underwent double jaw surgery and have since not taken part in any form of exercise and feel very unfit, but I still eat a well balance diet for the most part!After surgery however I lost over 20lbs in around 2 months and then gained it all back in the following 4 I had a hard time psychologically during recovery for a plethora of varied reasons and also unexpectedly became a carer for a relative who developed dementia whilst I was still recovering, this took a toll on mental health and I fell into a bit of a depression, I was prescribed Sertraline 50mg in late September 2022 however my mental health has VASTLY improved, it is my physical health that is bothersome.I also have a history of IBS and GERD (diagnosed over 10 years ago so is my normal but has slowly gotten a little worse over time).I reached out with no urgency to doctors for a health check as my generally sense of physical health felt at an all time low. I wanted to reassess IBS and GERD with focus on regular urgent diarrhoea (occasionally up to 6x a day), and regular nausea. Additionally I find myself easily very short of breath, dizzy and nauseous, and ultimately I feel weak. The disconcerting feeling this brings means I avoid any physical activity (historically I have enjoyed being more active). I noted that my heart rate has been falling lower and lower in the last 8 months since surgery and I am not physically fit at the moment. I feel slow. Maybe I am just getting old I was given a battery of tests and most of my bloods are generally fine, I have some deficiencies eg. Folate (which I queried as I dont drink and enjoy my greens) but was advised that some people are built different and need more vits or nutrients than others and I just need to take supplements  I assume this may cause some of my symptoms such as diarrhoea?I also had a 24hr Holter monitor and results came through yesterday. I havent seen them but doc noted 357 counts of bradycardia with lows of 37bpm. Coupled with my nausea and dizziness, I have an urgent referral to cardiology (although that still means in 3 months).However when I read up on Bradycardia, it doesnt seem to be a concerning issue? I dont have the full results but is it only the coupling of my nausea etc that makes it more concerning. Unsure if relevant, but despite low heart rate I often have slightly high blood pressure.Tldr: is bradycardia with nausea and dizziness worthy of urgent cardiology referral? Can heart issues cause additional symptoms such as regular diarrhoea?Also not sure if relevant, but I had a persistent rash and redness and deep itch in left breast for last 2 months, ultrasound shows I have lots of benign cysts and a fibroadenoma, they (radiologist and consultant) seemed unconcerned but did biopsy due to my age and I will get results soon, the lack of concern from consultant means I have little concern also (my mother has fibroadenomas that have never caused any issues), but thought I would add everything that ails me! Ha! In case there is some magical connection to it all.Thanks! ###Output :What is your normal heart rate? Was it sinus bradycardia? How long were these episodes in duration?. Also would be helpful to know any medications other than the SSRI and whether you have sleep apnea, have had Lyme or chagas disease or are hypothyroid.To he honest I would also be surprised if it is sinus bradycardia that it is causing your symptoms rather than vice versa. Nausea and bowel movements are an excellent way to temporarily lower your heart rate. Most often it is just a normal variant, and if it is sinus bradycardia almost never requires a pacemaker. Wouldnt get too overwrought.The downside is i there is no magical connection here to any issue other than maybe being a symptom of nausea, which isnt that magical.",ERROR,
"###Input :31F, went to the ER due to stomach pain and uncontrollable shivering. She was admitted to the ICU and had extremely low blood sugar, hypothermia, hyperkalemia, blood in the stool, gram positive cocci in pairs and chains, anemia, and she had been previously diagnosed with endometriosis. They found cysts in the liver, hypodensity in the left side of the brain and have been taking several tests. ER gave her 3 blood transfusions for the anemia and she now has a swollen back, legs, hands, and feet. She is still anemic even after the 3 blood transfusions. She has undergone multiple MRI, ultrasounds, CAT scans, and blood works but they aren't sure what is causing everything.Her vitals at admission were:K 5.9Hgb 5.5Glucose 17Temp 94.5WBC 5700She started antibiotics yesterday morning and her second ecg was normal. She was taking oxycodone for pain but is now on morphine and lidocaine. Doctors said that she had a reaction to her 3rd blood transfusion and her heart rate went up and blood pressure went down. She is now on medication for that. She has not been allowed any food or water today after the reaction. An MRI found that she has lesions in her brain but the nuero surgery consultant said they were not going to do any procedure.Has anyone had experience with something similar and what was the diagnosis? ###Output :While I have lots of experience with patients like her, I dont think theres much that can be said over the internet to help. She has a severe critical illness with what sounds like septic shock. The best people to answer your questions is the team of doctor taking care of your sister.",ERROR,
"###Input :29F, 5'2, 80 something lbs, end stage liver failure etc.This one might be long, but I appreciate any kind of advice or input. I'm concerned my sister has been kind of pushed to the side since COVID19 and she's currently in critical, critical condition despite having been discharged. My family is confused on what to do, how to help her, especially since she's been denied a liver transplant. But anyways, here it goes:On March 5th my sister was found collapsed on her bathroom floor, she was completely yellow. Her boyfriend rushed her to the ER, where he was told to call family (us) because she wouldn't make it. From there she was transferred to a larger hospital, placed in surgical ICU and had a team immediately on her case. At this point her liver was failing, and she had an infection but they didn't know the source nor the bacteria causing it. She couldn't breathe on her own etc. Over the next week they threw all the antibiotics at her hoping something would stick, put a tube in her stomach to drain fluid that had built up around her bladder, put her on 24/7 dialysis since her kidneys began to fail, so many tests ran, I unfortunately can't recall all the details right now but if there are any specific questions I can likely answer.It was very touch and go for a while but her fever had gone away despite never finding out the source of infection. She was tolerating the dialysis and the last day I saw her she looked like she was doing a little bit better. Then COVID-19 hit my state and we were no longer allowed to visit her. Phone updates from the RN told us she was doing better, but they never had any specific information on what specific doctor's were saying, questions we had just weren't getting answered and my sister was unable to tell us what was going on. Within one week, we were told she was well enough to go down to general, despite previously being told she would go down to regular ICU first, and be in the hospital for at the very least a total of 6 weeks. She could breathe (not very well) on her own at this point and could communicate, so the hospital was no longer relaying information to us despite her not being in good enough condition to actually understand what was going on and couldn't remember what doctor's were saying to her. The next day we get a call that she's getting a port placed for out patient dialysis, and she was discharged that same day.We knew she wouldn't be 100% obviously but thought she would be better than she is. She comes home and can't walk, can't breathe very well at all, is completely yellow, is in constant pain and honestly looks like she won't be able to make it much longer. We don't know if she can survive with this liver, she was denied a transplant (whole 'nother story) and despite getting outpatient dialysis she looks worse and worse. She was told she was getting a home care nurse, they aren't coming now. She was supposed to originally be getting PT, they won't come out anymore (honestly don't think she's at that point now anyways). I'm trying to facilitate the care she needs and I'm trying to get her appointments set up but all doctors are only doing video call (completely understand). I'm just so scattered right now and have no idea why she was discharged. Should I take her back? Will they even be able to do anything? I don't understand and I'm just looking for any kind of advice I can get.Edit: The liver failure was precipitated by alcohol abuse and exasperated by the sepsis from her bladder infection. The last we had heard from the transplant team was that she was considered a good candidate (after 3 interviews) despite the alcohol abuse. We got a letter in the mail yesterday stating the denial. I am not trying to negate from the alcohol abuse, that was the reason her liver failed. Just that she also had a lot else going on that led to the condition she is in. ###Output :Posts by unflaired users that claim legitimacy by virtue of professional medical experience are not allowed.If you are a medical professional who wishes to become a verified contributor to this subreddit, please message the moderators with a link to a picture of your medical ID, student ID, diploma, or other form of verification.

"###Input :To clarify, just because the organs aren't necrotic doesn't mean they are functioning. Also organ donation has nothing to do with DNR. The appropriateness of someone to donate only comes after they have died or are literally about to. In the US people self-declare at the DMV so the organ donation services already know their intent in most cases.He has multisystem organ failure, plus underlying conditions which will make his recovery harder than someone without those (alcoholism, solitary kidney) based on what you have written, so it is absolutely imperative to find out what his wishes might be regarding code status. In the absence of any clear directives from the patient in the past, the family is asked to predict what the patient would choose for themself if they were able to sit in on the discussion and weigh in--basing this off of past comments, how they engaged (or avoided) healthcare interventions on their own, etc.I suggest that his designated healthcare agent and any other family present, have a care conference with the intensivist. This is a time set aside in a nearby conference room, not at the bedside or in the hall. Include one of his nurses if possible, any specialists who can make it (often harder to arrange) and then the unit's social worker/case manager. The purpose is to outline exactly where he is on his trajectory, what the major challenges are, what the expected chances of recovery appear to be at this point, and then a discussion of next steps. Find out more about why the doctor was recommending DNR. Hear what they have to say about this based on their experience. It might be because they don't feel he will likely be resuscitated if they make attempts, therefore, to attempt shocks and compressions would be futile. If they feel it would be futile, then it would represent only harm to the patient and not comfort or cure. I cannot predict what they are thinking so you need to find out, but this has been my experience from working in ICU as an RN and Care Manager.If he cannot be weaned off of the vent shortly, he will need a trach and a PEG (feeding tube in his side). If he stabilizes enough to be discharged from ICU (off of CRRT, off of high vent settings, off of any vasopressors that are stabilizing his BP, only on X number of antibiotics, etc) then he will meet criteria to transfer to a ventilator rehabilitation hospital or LTACH (long term acute care hospital).If this happens, it is a long slog. Is it something he would want? Also, he might not survive it and could have a downturn at any time, heading back to the hospital. Knowing this, is this something the family would predict HE would want? If so, you have your answer. If not, then it is appropriate to consult hospice to make him comfortable. Another service to consult if you have it available is Palliative Care. In many hospitals they are consulted for complex cases like this who are taking a long time to recover. They are particularly helpful to the patient to improve quality of life while recovering, as well as provide support and guidance to family.At the end of this long post, I offer you two things. One-you are in my thoughts. I know how difficult this is and you are on a crash course of learning right now. Two, please use this resource that many families in your position find extremely helpful--patients let us know so often this has helped them in cases like yours: Hard Choices for Loving People booklet ###Output :If this was me I would want a DNR and a DNI signed. More importantly, I would want a MOLST form singed indicating exactly the care that I would want, the care that I don't want, and for how long. That is to say, give me antibiotics for one week and see how I do, if nothing's happening then stop all unnecessary treatments.What I like to see in patients is an end goal. What happens far too often, is patients will sit in an ICU for an extended period of time deconditioning and not getting better, but family does not want to do anything for fear of making the situation worse or feeling like they are murdering a family member by taking away care. Recognize that his pancreas is not well at all. His kidneys are not well at all. His liver is not well at all. Assumedly, his lungs aren't either.Let's say he is extubated. Now we have a burnt pancreas. And kidney. And liver. If you are this young and have liver dysfunction or failure, that's a life of slowly getting sicker and sicker until you can possibly but probably not get a liver transplant in the future. It's painful. If his kidneys are truly shot and he requires dialysis in the future, that's 50 years of spending 3 days a week going to get dialysis and sitting there having your blood cycled over and over for hours, just to go home and not feel well. Then you do it again. Then you do it again. That's a lot of stress for a 30-year-old. A 30-year-old that already has alcoholism. If your pancreas is constantly becoming inflamed, diabetes maybe in the future or at least insulin dependence. A 30-year-old diabetic will have a low quality of life.DNR and DNIs are to preserve a patient's dignity thinking about the long-term consequences to their health and quality of life. The idea that saving people is enough, is not enough. By stating do not resuscitate, You're saying to give a chance, but don't take it farther than he would like given all that has happened, and will happen in the future.The doctor sees this all the time. The doctor sees a family that holds on to hope that everything will be okay because their family member is "" a fighter, "" but neglects to see that the patient has already fought 25 rounds and has been knocked out three times. And also neglects to see that, if they come out of the fight, they essentially will have an agonizing future for the rest of their life.",ERROR,
"###Input :Hello Reddit,My younger brother was 27, Male, maybe 6 foot and 375 pounds, half white/asian, no drugs, no smoking, extremely rarely drinking (like less than once a month).I don't recall what his early symptoms were but I found a virtual chat that said he may of had ""uncomplicated cystitis"" and had antibiotics prescribed for it. He saw a urologist and eventually had a nephrostomy tube, then had surgery later and was noted with a failed kidney. They were unable to remove it due to his weight and having hemorrhage concerns, at least that was my understanding, and that's it for a his existing medical condition, with an exception.I'm first wondering how he developed this condition to begin with. Would the failed kidney have caused the infection? I wish I had the full records so I could paint a better picture, but ultimately I can only guess that his high blood pressure was a cause, plus having a high stress job.Ever since all this, he had to urinate every like hour and this caused issues with work and sleep. I really don't understand why this kept happening and nothing was given to him for it. Would having a failed kidney cause that? This started back at the end of 2020 and the tube and surgery may have been in Q2/3? I now can't remember what happened first.From that I'm mostly wondering about the reason for frequent urination and if he would have got infected some other way outside of high blood pressure. He almost never leaves the house, and I fear he'd only get sick if a family member came home with something.Fast forward to the bulk of my reason to post. On January 13, 2023 he mentioned some nasal congestion and some body aches. He didn't seem to get better on the 14th so I asked if he wanted to see a doctor and he said not yet. This eventually came with some headaches so we tried to go to an urgent care but the wait times were 3+ hours so we figured try a Teladoc (98point6 for this call) and get an appointment later. He mentions a head ache lasting 4-5 days, dull/sharp pains in waves from front to back, also going behind his eyes. He was taking ibuprofen, and was asked about a fever and he said he wasn't sure but his head seems warmer compared to his body. They basically said to take Afrin and Excedrin and go to urgent care if things don't get better. When he went to take the afrin that night, he blew his nose and had a nose bleed, and per our father he had nose bleeds from time to time, but not that super often.Come January 19 I take him to urgent care and I do have his visit summary. Blood pressure 174/89 (why the fuck didn't anyone talk about this), temporal temperature of 98.1 (maybe the medication lowered it?), pulse 90, respiration 18, oxygen saturation 97. They gave him Toradol and sent him home. I feel like a fucking asshole that I wasn't in there with him, I had to drop him off and attend a work meeting that I should of canceled, and our mother picked him up. This is all very local, like within 15 minute drives.He doesn't seem to get better and on the 22nd he talks about some vision issues so I immediately take him to the nearest ER, which is a satellite and not attached to a large hospital. He goes to a back room almost immediately after checking in - alone, and again I feel like a fucking loser as I should of gone there with him to help explain everything - who knows exactly what he said since he was dealing with headaches. I did come back and talk to one of the nurses, but that didn't seem to change anything they expected.He had the following lab tests done, CBC With Diff, CG4 PANEL POC, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel Poc, PCR Influenza A & B and Covid 19 (POCT). Also had a CT Head W/O Contrast and EKG. Done today was just the CG4 and Comprehensive Metabolic, guess the CBC was still processing? I don't recall any notes on this, and his MyChart is closed.They didn't seem to find anything, even though he had a 171/105 blood pressure, they did ask if he had history and I didn't have a full answer, but said it wouldn't be surprising since the rest of the family has medication for it, but he didn't have a primary care doctor to prescribe it. He had trouble finding one since COVID and it really pisses me off that I didn't help him find one somehow. He also had 100.1 temperature.They gave him .9% NaCl (NS), tylenol, benadryl, toradol and reglan, and sent him home.The next day I don't remember exactly what triggered this, maybe balance, but we took him to the ER attached to the hospital and the doctor almost immediately said he wasn't going home that night, he saw something. They put him in a gown and my brother was shivering mad, and he normally likes it cold. Sometime that night I believe he got a room and had some tests, and they said he had meningitis, and shortly after was uncertain of contagious so the room was adjusted and we had to wear N95 masks and a face shield / gown. This went for maybe 2-3 days, and it bothers me so much because this was the most critical time that I could of had talking to my brother and I minimized my time like a coward and asshole. I believe our mother was there the whole time though.After that 2-3 days it was cleared for bacterial and said likely viral (they never said what he had) and the additional PPE was stopped. I remember he texted me to bring apple juice, yogurt, and fruit cups, which I did, but asked if it was okay because I thought hospitals didn't want outside food. They said it was okay as long as it conformed to a low sodium diet, which those did.During this I know he had a lumbar puncture, which is likely how they found the meningitis, and had a CT/MRI that they said was clear. Then suddenly the next day he developed delirium. He was able to answer our questions and knew who we were, but it was like he was living in a video game or something. He'd also spring up very quickly pulling wires to urinate (and frequently) which caused concerns for the monitoring and fall prevention, since he was a little wobbly and I think bumped his side one day because of the bar being down for the accessibility access for the toilet.The doctors believed the delirium was due to his lowered sodium levels, which could have been to the frequent urination and low sodium diet. He was drinking a ton of Gatorade at home back home, probably around the 16th I was buying him multi-packs as I felt those helped me recover. Eventually they put him on a EEG and because of the frequent getting up and sometimes he'd just try to rip the things off, they restrained him. I wasn't there when it happened but our mom was there and it sounded a little traumatic, like saying ""why are you doing this mommy, and then attempting to bite her"". Not sure if that's exactly what happened but he was restrained. Either at that point or shortly after he did have a nurse assigned to be next to him 24/7 to monitor, and help him pee as he'd be responsive if he had to go and the nurses asked.During this delirium he'd talk about random stuff, sounded like he was in a game, he couldn't explain where he was, but he was still answering questions. Everyday I visited I'd ask if he knew who I was and he'd start by laughing and saying of course, and I had to be more specific with him and he'd confirm my name and that I'm his brother. During this time we had a family member with him 24/7, but would occasionally talk to him, I know I'd hold his hand and he'd squeeze back, but we'd end up sitting to the side talking to each or reading a book, etc.Finally on the 30th I was coming in to swap out with our father, who said that my brother was a bit quieter today, maybe he was finally getting some much needed sleep as it seemed like he wasn't getting any. I also noticed that he had an oxygen tube under his nose, which wasn't there before. I didn't want to wake him so I didn't do much, and this was the first day I decided to pop up my switch and play some yoshi crafted world, and I kept one ear bud out just in case.I know he had a lumbar puncture done either before I came or just as I came, and an MRI earlier (might have been the previous day, it's becoming a blur now and I hate it) and the neurologist said they see a lesion, and it looked like one of the quadrants of the brain. I honestly can't remember but it felt like a sizable portion. I also looked at the EEG from time to time as I assume they were looking for seizures and I swear I saw alerts on the machine detecting them.This was the first time that I was going to pull the all nighter, and it was normally our mother that would do that and I offered to stay but she wanted to get some rest which I understood. A bit after I was there I noticed they swapped the tube with an oxygen mask, and I regret to this day that I did not look at that monitor better, seeing if oxygen was dropping, etc. There was a nurse there but I don't know how well they were watching, I swear one of the guys before was on his phone most of the time. I remember there was a night shift change, and I don't recall how long after before the most traumatic part happens. I did ask if my brother snored normally to our parents, as I never really heard him sleep and our father said yes, and he should get a sleep study done. It reminded me of our father's sleep apnea when napping on the couch during movie night. I don't remember how long this went on for, but I think they adjusted the bed height or something, don't remember... yet another thing to add to my list of regrets.That night after playing a bit I remember my arms getting tired so I pulled the little side table near me to prop my switch up on so I could just use the remotes, and all of a sudden a bunch of nurses come rushing into the room and one of the nurses checks his neck and says no pulse, then a code blue is called. I am escorted out of the room and just panicking. I don't remember hearing the monitor beeping prior (remember 1 ear bud and I had the volume at like 1 tick), and I don't recall him snoring just before either. For all I know the sensors were faulted and he was out for awhile, I have no idea how immediate it was, or if maybe the table pulled/squeezed the oxygen tube (this all happened in like 10 seconds). I know that his monitor was beeping a lot earlier due to his blood pressure, and I don't know if they gave him medication, but I don't remember that monitor beeping at all that day. Maybe the last nurse silenced it? I don't know. I also don't know how well the nurse was watching. One of the nurses in the morning/afternoon was great and I know she was looking at his face and the monitor with great focus, and I fear the night nurses not so much. I know the nurse that night was from newborns, and just helping out.I don't understand why or how he code blued, how quick it was, or anything, but I know it took them over 20 minutes to bring him back and he was on a ventilator. They did the 24 hour thermal treatment of going cold then normal, and after that for the next few days they'd do an eye test and pain test with no responses. On February 1 they did some test with a dye to see blood movement in the brain and I saw the results that night saying there was little blood flow but not clinically brain dead. I had a spark of hope but knew I wasn't a doctor. The next day we talked to the neurologist and confirmed that he was indeed brain dead and I felt like I lost my brother for the 3rd time in that hospital. Once during delirium, then the cardiac arrest, and now. We had to decide when to pull the life support, and I watched him officially die, for what felt like the 4th time.Having to find the courage to join our father for the funeral arrangements, then the funeral which was a visitation before cremation, then picking up the urn a week later, it's been waves of trauma and it still feels like yesterday a month later. Everyday I've gone home to see my parents, and touch the urn and cry. I don't understand why he's in there and not at our house playing video games with his friends.I don't understand how he got sick to begin with, he moved in with me back in May and I tried to make things as comfortable for him as possible. This was his first winter with me and I think this house is a bit drier than the parents he lived with, but I wouldn't think that'd cause the issue. He almost never leaves, he works from home and plays games. If he caught anything it'd be from me, and I know I got sick at the end of June with COVID and he caught that from me, what a fucking loser I am. I did another trade show in September and got sick, not sure if he got it then, he didn't report time off to work (and he tries to take every time off he can).I don't understand why the teladoc didn't ask other questions, or the urgent care to find anything. Then later the first ER only commented on the high blood pressure, and it wasn't until the second ER that they knew something was up.Why did he get delirium, why did they let sodium levels drop? What was going on with the oxygen? With the monitoring he had, how did they let a cardiac arrest happen?I have so many questions and it pains me knowing that even if I get knew, it doesn't change that my baby brother is gone. We had so many plans this year, such as cooking better for ourselves, working out to lose weight, and most critically spending more time outside of his room to try new things like restaurants and take vacations. The last vacation I had with him was 2007, and he was in Hawaii with the parents in 2008 where I was rejected from going because I didn't have a job after high school.Before his delirium I remember one big ask, which was to get a hug, and that he was ready and wanting to go on adventures with me. I hadn't seen my brother much outside of a quick dinner talk from time to time, and when he moved in I was glad to be bonding with him again, and we didn't even get 1 year. We had so many plans, and the world robbed him of that.During the visitation I played the Halo song ""Never Forget"". He was a big Halo fan and that song always gave me the feels. I hugged his cold body for that entire song, wishing I could give him more.This is a long post and I apologize, I just needed to write, and I wonder if anyone knows what may have caused things. I fear that my lack of knowledge and experience failed to get him to the ER sooner, but it didn't seem like that even helped, they may have just done the same as they did on the first visit and turned him around.I failed to protect you brother, I am so sorry. This world is just not fair and you deserved so much more. You were the nicest person anyone would of met and you made those around you happier. I miss you so much brother, and I love you even more.I will see you again one day. ###Output :I'm sorry for your loss.Delirium can be caused by many factors including infections, metabolic imbalances, medications, and underlying medical conditions. In your brother's case, the low sodium levels may have played a role, but it is also possible that there were other contributing factors such as an underlying infection or a reaction to medications.His low sodium could be due to frequent urination, or due to his low sodium diet, or it could be due to an underlying medical condition such as adrenal insufficiency or kidney disease.Don't know about the oxygen - but, changes in oxygen levels can occur due to changes in respiratory function, changes in blood pressure, or changes in heart function.The fact that he was on monitoring does not guarantee that a cardiac arrest could not occur. It is possible that the cardiac arrest was due to an underlying medical condition or a sudden event such as an arrhythmia. But, ultimately I don't know.",ERROR,
"###Input :Scared to death - Possibly cancer (leukemia/lymphoma)Hi, my husband is a 26-year-old M. He is 510 and weighs 190 pounds. No medical history beside hypothyroidism and takes 100 mcg of Levothryoxine. His mother has hypothryoroidism and his brother had a condition as a small child where his body attacked the collagen in his skin (scleordermia??). He had Covid in June and recovered in 3-4 days. He had routine blood work done because he has never had blood work done, and I encouraged him to do that. He works out regularly, and never gets sick. He does not have enlarged lymph nodes, no night sweats, no pain, or fatigue, weight loss, ect.He initially received a call from a local family doctor towards the end of January about abnormal blood work. His neutrophils were coming in at 0.1 as well as low WBC and high lymphocytes, and they wanted us to follow up with hematology/oncology. We were told that this blood work did have a bad blood smear that could affect the results. We found a hematologist/oncologist with a major hospital nearby and the lab work down below has been done by her office.We met with her today, and she said that his lab work on the 1st was not significant, and she would have not accepted him as a client had this been his initial labs. However, since he had the initial 0.1 neutrophils with the other small practice, she took him on. She said the blood work was not too off on the 1st, but that she wanted repeat lab work done. The CBC from the 14th was done after our appointment. She said during our appointment that if the lab work looked similar or was trending outside of the ranges more so then she wanted to do a bone marrow biopsy.We are scared shitless, and this has flipped our world upside down. Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. What is your take from these test results? Has anyone experienced this and its not been something as serious as cancer?

All vaccines.3 weeks ago she started feeling achey. No upper respiratory stuff but general aches, fatigue and headache. Took several covid tests and negative. Ended up going to Hawaii where she thought she actually had covid there and those were also negative. She was complaining of the same thing. At one point, thought it was sun poisoning. Shes seemed to get worse and worse. A week later, which was 2 days after returning home she went to the ER for what she thought was severe dehydration. It wasnt that but they werent sure what it was. Said to see her pcp.ER doc did a handful of labs. Initially told her to see her pcp for follow up labs for mono or leukemia. Her joints ache, a weird floaty face feeling, no fever, no upper respiratory, majority of joint pain is in her legs and toes feel strange. Headaches here and there. Otherwise, she feels okay. No notice of brushing, bloody noses, rapid weight loss.Labs below. If a number is in here more than once its because it was the second lab test when increased.

"###Input :Husband with osteonecrosis and little game plan besides narcotics- is he being managed appropriately?Just a HUGE thanks in advance to anybody who responds. I'm a talker and I'm livid right now, so I'm trying to keep this just to necessities but may fail and leave out key details and/or talk about things that aren't necessary. To preface- I come from a ""medical family"" but it's primarily neuro and psych rather than ortho. I devour medical literature, podcasts, etc, have worked as nursing staff in psych and derm, just got my master's in health sciences, and am planning to apply to med school this cycle- so basically, please feel free to talk to me in technical terms, link to articles, etc as appropriate.Now onto the issue.Husband is 28M, 5'8.5"", 225lbs, white, occasionally smokes cigars (maybe a cigar or two a year?), and drinks moderately (down from heavy drinking a few years ago as part of work culture). About 5 weeks ago was diagnosed with osteonecrosis in both femoral heads. Started having pain just in his right hip in May, but really started to notice in June as it was limiting mobility. Got to the point in July where he couldn't go up and down the stairs- I was gone and he was texting me he had to army crawl back up the stairs to bed. Initially, he got an x-ray which had some ""fringe"" or something to that effect (I wasn't in the appointment so I don't really know what was said about it) but was concerning for possible osteonecrosis and MRI was recommended. While waiting, he went to PT, and the PT thought perhaps bursitis if not ON, but the pain kept worsening. Got an MRI at the end of August which showed osteonecrosis in both hips involving over 50% of both femoral heads. Right side had marked edema extending into the femoral neck and noted a ""mild asphericity of the head consistent with mild depression,"" subchondral fluid cleft, and diffusive mildly thinned cartilage. Left side had edema as well extending into the neck.Husband was referred to ortho, which in itself was a headache as PCP had to send that referral FOUR times. As we're waiting, his pain is getting worse to the point where he was using a cane and then progressed to needing a full set of crutches. If you could see his gait- it's just awful and was placing stress on other joints and was leading to back pain too. PCP started him on Celebrex 1000mg QAM for two weeks and then 500mg QAM after as well as gabapentin (titrated up to 900mg QHS). Got several labs drawn to check for a cause- including autoimmune labs- and the only abnormality was low vitamin D (15 ng/mL), so he was also started on OTC D3 5000IU daily and a prescription weekly dose of D2 (I can't remember the dosing). . The Celebrex seemed to help him the most, but after about a week on that, it was still only ""barely"" helping. As time went on waiting for ortho, the way he described the pain and sensation also changed, with more ""grinding"" pain.In what I've been able to read, it seems there are treatments that can help the pain (narcotics, staying off the joint, fluid aspiration for edema) and may treat earlier stages of disease (eg, core decompression, treating underlying cause to get blood flow back to the bone), but once the femoral head collapses, hip replacement becomes standard of care.When we were finally able to meet with ortho, the doc, while personable and nice, didn't really give us a lot of info. He didn't stage the disease at time of MRI, but kept saying ""mild."" This annoys me because with the amount of pain he is in and asphericity of the femoral head, I wouldn't classify anything he's experiencing as ""mild"" myself, and surely not ""caught early/in early disease stage."" We tried to impress the pain aspect and how limited his mobility is because of the pain. Doc kept hinting at ""something stronger"" to manage the pain and said we could schedule for aspiration for the edema. Also mentioned that he needed to stay off the joint as much as possible and should be using the crutches for any walking. Husband is terrified of needles (aspiration is done fully conscious and may need to be done every week or two to control pain from the edema), and with a history of SUDs in his family, being on narcotics for longer than a few days is also terrifying and he prefers not to. We asked about hip replacement, and he seemed not to want to do it, citing Husband's age. ORtho requested workup for potential coagulation disorder because we could ""save the hips"" if this was caused by a treatable clotting disorder, and he referred to hematology. No further discussion about replacement or why he didn't want to pursue it- just the age and potential for a clotting disorder.Neither one of us was thrilled with this. I wasn't convinced that restoring blood flow would magically re-shape his femoral head, especially with how he is now describing grinding pain. His half sister also does have a clotting disorder, but it's Factor V deficiency, so it's that she doesn't clot appropriately. But fine. Took them a week to get the referral to hematology, and a few days later, we have to call hematology and essentially was told he is a ""low priority"" patient and they wouldn't see him (they were rude, but I do get it because oncology patients need to take priority). Ortho refused to order the tests because ""we don't really order tests"" and said they'd send it to PCP. No follow-up scheduled with ortho until after the coag tests. This was about two weeks ago.About 10 days ago, his pain advanced so much that he finally did call in to the ortho clinic to as he was unable to sleep he was in so much pain. I picked up a script for 5mg oxycodone for him, and he's been taking this before bed reliably since and sometimes needs it during the day due to the pain. He hates it, and it barely touches the pain anyway. He called again last week because he is still in so much pain and essentially demanded to see the surgeon himself so we can get real answers about how we are not just going to ""manage"" the pain but resolve it. Thankfully, we see the surgeon tomorrow.Anyway, so today, we were able to meet with his PCP via telemedicine (he couldn't get to the actual hospital due to his limited mobility right now and still make it to the ortho appointment tomorrow). His PCP essentially said they a) weren't going to order any of the coag tests ortho wanted (they didn't have any notes from ortho and ""it isn't standard of care"") and if they wanted coag tests, they'd have to order themselves, and b) my husband ""needs"" to be more active, going to PT, walking, swimming if he can't put weight on it (note: the only pools here this time of year are at expensive gyms we cannot afford to go to), etc. My husband literally cannot do that. If he goes up and down the stairs more than once in a day, he's knocked on his ass in pain for the next 24 hours. He tried to impress this upon her, but she just kept saying how he needs to move it to avoid muscle atrophy, and if he can't, then the pain isn't managed appropriately. I don't disagree about his pain- it's not managed well at all- but her solution was to increase the gabapentin which tbh I don't think is helping him at all anyway. The bit about moving the joint more though directly goes against everything I've read about the disease, what the ortho told us, and what he experiences- he can manage his pain by being totally 100% sedentary, but that's not a lifestyle he wants (nor what is good long-term).So, wonderful docs of reddit, is he being managed appropriately so far? Is there something more I can do to ensure he has good care? I don't go into telemed visits with him since he takes him on headphones, but I do have to go with him when he goes in to the clinic since he cannot get around with me. I asked my older sis to send me some of the info on UpToDate so I can read more about what is actual standard of care. I cannot for the life of me feel good about it, and I feel like nobody is listening to him and his pain and what HE wants (solution, not management). Our world has radically shifted very rapidly, as he cannot do much at all or engage in hobbies or household chores or even the fun parts of a relationship most of the time. We are seeing a therapist to help manage it, even, but all the medical teams seem to be doing is throwing narcotics and giving him mixed messages and refusing to actually give us real insight into the disease process or why they don't want to resolve it. And yeah, I'm really mad about it all.Thanks again to anybody that can give me any insight into this. ###Output :Osteonecrosis / avascular necrosis of the hip, it can be bad. I kinda agree with the ortho - be as reluctant as possible with a hip prosthesis. I don't like the term ""hip replacement"", cause it makes it sound like you change the hip with an equivalent. It's not. A metal prosthesis has a limited life span - 10 - 20 years. Given enough time, the prosthesis will eventually fail. He's young, so he'll be doomed to have a failure while still in prime age. Then he'll have a bigger problem, since replacing a replacement is a much bigger surgery, sometimes it may not be possible at all, and there's a chance he'll have to remove a hip joint altogether while still only 40-some years old.There's a chance his osteonecrosis may dwindle, without completely destroying the femoral head. Sometimes it just leaves a small irregularity in the top joint surface, and it can be usable. I often see that the ""acute"" inflammation like necrosis dies out. It would be wise to wait and see how things progress. Hopefully, he can have pain relief with medications temporarily.So, I think the treatment right now seems wise. You want the problem to be solved right now with a hip replacement, but the ortho know that will bite you back in a few decades. When he says it's mild, he's probably referring to how it looks on xray, and mild there is a good thing.",ERROR,
"###Input :Ascites 4 weeks post-op, acute renal failureUpdate: Over 5L of fluid was drained from my dads abdomen today. The fluid was high in creatinine and consistent with urine. He initially felt much better, but then started experiencing extreme pain, likely from muscle spasms due to the drastic change in his body over the course if only 2 hours. His O2 dropped to 86 due to the pain. He is now medicated for pain and sleeping on and off. We are hoping that his status will improve over the next few days. Thank you to everyone that commented.70M, 6ft even, 205 lbs, Barrett's esophagus, eczemaHistory of heavy smoking decades ago that was reduced to once or twice per day in the 1980s. Uses edibles/microdosing to manage anxiety and depression.Regular medications include acid reducers for well-monitored esophagus and fish oils and supplements for controlled eczema. Very active lifestyle for age including managing half acre yard, frequent 15 to 20 mile bike rides when weather permits, strength training at gym multiple times per week.January 12th, dad underwent robot assisted prostate removal. Lymph nodes were clear and there was one area where cancer had spread one millimeter into outside tissues. No radiation is recommended at this time. He was disharged home with a catheter. The catheter was removed one week later, but about 18 hours after it was removed, he was having trouble urinating and developed severe pain. He went to the ER cathed again. He was determined to have continued swelling in his urethra.A few days later, a cystogram with his surgeon revealed a small tear in his bladder where his bladder and urethra meet. His surgeon said that he expects the tear to heal on its own.My dad was admitted to the ER today for increasing discomfort in his abdominal area with pain and diarrhea. When I showed up, I noticed that his abdomen was visibly distended. CT confirmed ascites. Nothing else to note other than a 2 mm calcification in a kidney and cirrhosis. He is a recovered alcoholic that hasn't touched alcohol in 37 years. Labs shows some RBCs and WBCs in his urine. Also indicated acute kidney failure. BUN 56 mg/dL, creatinine 4.54 mg/dL, eGFR-Cr 13 mL/min/1.73m2.It is a lymphatic leak? Maybe urine leak caused it? If so, what next? ###Output :In a patient with cirrhosis and new onset renal failure with swelling by the prostatic urethra, your dad appears to be at risk for urinary retention because of how much inflammation and swelling there is by the pelvis at the neck of the urethra. A simple noninvasive bladder scan can be done at the urologist's office after he voids or is allowed to empty his bladder completely , called a ""post void residual"". If there is more than 300-450 cc (every doc has their own cutoff) after a reasonable attempt to empty every last drop, he is considered to have urinary retention. This can cause urine to flow backwards and cause backpressure into the kidneys, effectively causing hydronephrosis (which can be picked up on a renal ultrasound (ultrasound of kidneys), or CT scan of the abdomen. Obstructive uropathy is this condition and can be source of renal failureAlso, ascites is not uncommon in decompensated cirrhosis. Make sure your dad is on a low salt diet. Also it is important to check a Complete metabolic panel or hepatic function panel to see his albumin level. Low albumin can contribute to ascites. Your dad could be in what we call hepatorenal syndrome if his cirrhosis is not under control and can lead to renal failure and death.",ERROR,

Urgent Care Docs had advised me that any escalation of symptoms should mean I go to the Emergency Room. Once there they almost immediately checked me into the ICU for observation and began running every test you could name. For the next 4/5 days I did just an unreal number of scans, 2 biopsies, and they drew enough blood to fill a small pool. Pain escalated daily while there so finding a solution was a running theme. So after a lot of trails here's what they found:Current: Stage 4 Aggressive Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer ( Adenocarcinoma )Previous: Disseminated Intravascular CoagulationAfter doing a Lymph Node & Bone Marrow Biopsy they found my marrow filled to capacity with dead cancer cells. This pointed them in the right direction. My platelets were crashing daily (20,000 at admission) and I've got inflamed lymph nodes throughout my chest cavity which is one source of my (significant and at time escalating) pain. Its infiltrated my lungs and several vertebrae along my spine (causing vertebrae to show signs of Osteopenia) . Weirdly enough there's no noticeable tumor/mass/lump they can trace it back to. It's kind of just spread throughout (described as Adenocarcinoma) , though they were finally able to locate a small ulcer in my stomach that allowed them to finally be able to classify it. I've currently just completed my 3rd (now weekly) round of chemo (we started asap when other options such as clinical trials were deemed a non-option) and we've been able to stabilize a number of things (blood factors such as platelets, hemoglobin and the like) along the way. Many of my blood counts are still in the trash so clinical trails are not currently an option. In early stages of my 3 weeks hospital visit I was in a state called **DIC (**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which caused me to act like something akin to a blood squirt gun if i bled. Essentialy it screws with you clotting factors and any bleeding event is an issue. Any procedure became an issue and many my numbers were artifically raised in order to attempt anything that would cause me to bleed. Fortunately after a week of treatments and what felt like several wheel barrows of infusions we kicked my body out of D.I.C and am more or less clotting normally. Fun story: early one morning after the vampires took their daily does of my blood a CNA came in to do a routine vitals check. This particular morning they took 2 unique sets of blood samples plus a rather large sample for testing against infectious disease. This was also kind of at the height of my ""he's not clotting"" phase. During the blood pressure check it popped open all the fresh holes in my arm, causing them to bleed and freaked/surprised the CNA. Made me laugh. (end of story). Immunotherapy is what my Oncologist are banking on right now so crossing my fingers. Chemo is causing reasonable progress (numbers are low but stable) so we're staying the course for now. My personal mid->long term goal is to find an alternative to opiates for pain management (who the hell knows why a person tolerates opiates for a buzz cause constipation sucks!!!) so looking at alternatives (THC pills potentially or preferably resolving the issue that's causing me pain) I've been discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks so now I'm working to find a routine that works. Losing weight so a short term goal is stopping that (I'm rather tall and (was) muscular so my bodies nuking whatever calories I put in and I'm not putting in a lot due to general nausea, but smoothies have been my friend. Please let me know if you have any questions or advice.. I'll answer what I can and absorb what reasonable advice I read. ###Output :Man, that was not high on my list of possibilities after your original description. Sorry to hear. Give it hell.",ERROR,
"###Input :Doctors please help my little sister, she can't walk, I'm afraid she's going to die8F, 78lbs, no medication. She was in the hospital for a long time but they discharged her. She is still in pain, please help. I attached the notes of her discharge.The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as within normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever. ###Output :Internal medicine doc here but in my differential is Adult Onset Stills Disease which can still present in children and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The salmon colored rash lasting a few minutes is textbook for Adult Onset Stills Disease.I'm assuming she had blood cultures done at one or multiple points during her admission. Did she have a procalcitonin tested? Did she receive any antibiotics? Any steroids like solumedrol, prednisone etc? Does she still have joint pain? Does this rash show up only during febrile episodes? Any auto immune conditions in the family like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, hashimotos?",ERROR,
"###Input :ostive ANA test, titer of 1:320 and speckled pattern, but negative Connective tissue testI'm a 35 yo Caucasian female, 5'5 and 170 lbs (back to back pregnancies), I vape, I take Omeprazole and lyrica 200 mg daily. The lyrica is for seizures, not pain.Ok, so I just had a bunch of labs drawn, because I've been having numerous symptoms of an autoimmune disease. Chronic fatigue, mouth sores that will randomly show up, lots of head aches, severe random bouts of pain that show up in joint areas that debilitates me when they ""flare up"". Crippling anxiety, and depression is worsening. And lastly, a random rash that will spread across my cheeks and nose, and sometimes radiate into the tips of my ears.I had a positive ANA test, but the more specific tests showed that I was negative for connective tissue disorders like lupus, RA and sjogrens to name a few. Everything looked fine, and my doctor told me that I probably just have inflammation somewhere in my body.My questions are:. Could I still have something like lupus, even tho the CTD labs were negative, but ANA had all 3 parts show abnormal results? And, this isn't my first positive ANA test. It happened 6 years ago, but nothing further was looked into. Where do I go from here to get better answers? All these symptoms are debilitating my life. ###Output :techincally you could still have something on the spectrum of connective tissue diseases with current antibodies negative, but +ANA are pretty common in the health population. best bet is probably continuous follow up with a single primary care doctor, and referral to whatever specialists they think best.",ERROR,
"###Input :Elevated esr and crp with sudden symptoms (started 2 weeks ago)Hi doctors!27 year old female 6 months postpartum, weaning of breastfeeding currently. (If relevant)A few weeks ago I got a bug (negative for covid) towards the end I started having hand cramps, foot cramps, muscle pain in my legs and arms and joints, tiny spasms all over including my face and then followed by pins and needles all over and sometimes a burning feeling in skin. I will state, I have had this type of thing happen before a couple years back. I also have severe health anxiety and have been under immense stress.I went to the dr. And he did blood work. Cbc, comprehensive panel, vit d, magnesium, b12, esr, and crp. Everything was normal except for the esr and crp. Esr was 40 and I cant remember the crp level, but it was mildly elevated. Fast forward to this week, I went to the er for related symptoms (they have improved some) dr re checked blood work. Esr went up to 55 so obviously I have some inflammation somewhere. They said it wouldnt be from being sick, not caused by being obese, or stressed or anxious. They kind of hinted at MS and let me tell you that sent me into a real panic. Dr suggested my pcp order a mri of spine and brain. My pcp did so and also sent an urgent referral to rheumatology. Urgent as in November 30th being the soonest appt.I looked at my labs from a few years back and had the same elevated markers that went back down. I also had a rheumatology panel done then and everything was normal. Ana negative.My symptoms seem to be improving but Im still not feeling 100%. I have been a ball of anxious nerves since this has started so its hard to tell the difference. Now Im convinced I have ms or some debilitating disease. ###Output :ESR elevation is extremely nonspecific. Any inflammatory condition can raise it. Any sickness can get you to the 40-50s. It's up, but not particularly high.I think your doctor is probably managing things well from what you've described.",ERROR,
"###Input :27F immunocompromised and sick for two weeks. Getting worse. Rheumatologist is out of town and ER doctor sent me home pending blood test results that are still processing. Insight?Demographics: 27 female. Height 5ft 6in, weight 190lbs. Married.Conditions: rheumatoid arthritis and lupus; SVT.Meds: 2000mg sulfasalazine, 400mg plaquenil, 200mg Cimzia injection every two weeks.Non-smoker, no alcohol, no caffeine.Duration of complaint: 2weeksI have four doses of pfizer covid vaccine.Currently negative for covid.Two weeks ago before my scheduled Cimzia injection I spiked a low-grade fever. It was about 37.8c. Since then, my temperatures have been 37.5c to 38.5c. Acetaminophen will not bring my temperature down. It initially started with fatigue and headache and fever.Last week I began to get a sore throat, sweating, clamminess, chills, mild sinus pressure, confusion, shortness of breath, and a slight cough.I went in for monthly rheumatology bloodwork on 7/28. Ill attach the results. Mildly decreased WBC and Neutrophils.On 7/29 I went to the emergency room as my primary doctor instructed me to because I was not improving. Many cultures were taken. WBC further decreased and neutrophils were more than half of the previous day. There is a WBC Morphology pending pathologist review.Sepsis cultures have not shown any growth over the day.X-ray of chest showed no abnormality.Im confused as to what could be causing this. The ER doctor also said he was confused and it could be a medication or a nasty virus (was not tested for these) and that I have neutropenia and I am quite immune compromised but left it at that.Today, 7/30, I have had more difficulty breathing, particularly with movement or talking. Im coughing green/yellow thick mucus. More fatigue. My lungs feel heavy.Im thinking of heading back to the ER tomorrow if symptoms get worse, but Im not sure it will do any good for me or provide me with more.Is there any insights?Ive reached out to my rheumatologists receptionist as well as my primary doctor. However, Monday here is a holiday so the offices are closed. The earliest I could see my primary is on Tuesday, and Im not sure how much further it will progress by then.here is the link to my imgur albumI understand that some of the blood work with the hematology panel is still pending.Also, what does it mean with the WBC morphology Reviewed by technologist Sent to Pathologist for review?Thank you in advanced ###Output :I wouldn't wait a day more. Go to the ER. In my opinion you should be started on broad spectrum antibiotics asap, while waiting for results.",ERROR,
"###Input :Chest/Neck CT/PET in preparation for lymph node biopsy for neurological/rheumatologic(?) symptoms, also showed lung nodule?Hello everyone! I just had a chest CT and neck CT with contrast to evaluate lymphadenopathy of the neck as well as potential lymph node activity of the chest, and to move towards a lymph node biopsy.This is what was found so far (also had an ER ultrasound showing multiple mildly enlarged lymph nodes in parotid, submandibular, levels 1 and 2 no fatty hilum)-Multiple nonenlarged reactive appearing cervical chain lymph nodes bilaterally. Asymmetric 0.9 cm left level 5 and 4/5 nodes, with preservation of the fatty hilum, likely reactive. Subcentimeter right retropharyngeal node similar to the recent cervical spine MR, with an elongated reactive appearance.My ENT, advised by the rheumatologist I am seeing, was somewhat hesitant on doing the biopsy before having a PET scan done because she stated a biopsy would interfere with a PET/CT for 12 weeks afterwards. The PET scan was recommended by the rheumatologist, as we do not have solid leads for the issues I am having and per his words can collect more sensitive data. I have symptoms progressing by the day, and would like to go ahead with the biopsy and forgo the PET scan also because of the high radiation dose. My questions are, does a biopsy really impact PET results for so long, and would it make sense to perform? Can I request the biopsy first instead? Also, would an excisional biopsy really be needed over a core needle biopsy?The CT also found a 4 mm right lower lobe nodule adjacent to pleura image versus subpleural atelectasis. Should i be concerned about this nodule or its location, and could it represent a rheumatologic disease process?I appreciate any advice! I am a mystery case to all the doctors I have seen and feel completely utterly hopeless.28F, 57, 172 lbs, Asian, No drug use or smoking of any kind, Current Medications include Levothyroxine, estrogen, and progesteronePrimary Issue- Multi system wide involvement including neurological, dermatologic, possible rheumatologist, endocrinologic- Severe neurological presentation of symptoms beginning as constant left-sided facial pain, progressing to tingling and cold, then constant numbness and deadness of sensation in peri orbital area, decreased corneal reflex, whole cheek, down to jaw, and through lips, combined with massive headaches in occipital temple and behind the eye, feels like face is falling off face and sagging. Loss of muscle in face and body as well as muscle twitching/pulsing in top and bottom eyelids (right and left) constant muscle twitching/aches/pain in random muscles throughout body. Recently spread of pain in parotid, submandibular, occipital, ear canal, left neck, supraclavicular areas with associated mildly enlarged and reactive lymph nodes, mostly on left but also bilaterally. Very recently tightness, compression, and loss of sensation in left front of foot and back of left calf which is still present.Many other non-neurological symptoms, have seen 60+ doctors.Duration: 2 years of worsening symptoms. ###Output :Reactive lymph nodes are usually from some infection or inflammation and biopsy will likely not be helpful. Id say go for the PET first. The lung nodule does not seem worrisome. PET once again may be helpful to see if it is metabolically active",ERROR,
