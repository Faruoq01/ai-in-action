       "\"###Input :My daughter ( F, 18 y/o, 5'5', 165lbs) has been feeling poorly for a 6-8 months. She had COVID a couple of months ago and symptoms have are much worse in the last month or so. Symptoms seem POTS-like. She feels light headed, breathless, dizzy, HR goes from ~65 lying down to ~155-160 on standing. Today she tells me HR has been around 170 all day and she feels really lousy. (She using an OTC pulse ox to measure.) She has a cardiology appt but not until March and a PCP appt but not until April since she's at school and it's a new provider. What to do? Is this a on call nurse sort of issue? Or a trip to the ED? Or wait till tomorrow and try for an early appt? Try a couple of Valsalvas? Wait it out until her cardio appt? Or? She's away at school if Boston, what to do? Thank you ###Output :If she actually has a HR of 170 that is accurate, ongoing and persistent, she needs to be seen in the ED immediately.\""
